Hi, I am Xunzhe Wen, a computer vision engineer. My interests range from machine learning in general to indurstial AI algorithm. 

I am working on computer vision system development (Object Detection, Deformable image registration) and mobile deployment under the a start-up located at Western Ontario Area, Canada.

I studied BA, Biomedical Engineering at [Central South University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_South_University) and MS, Computer Engineering at [University of Ottawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Ottawa), with a focus on computer vision and data analysis.


##### My Programming Languages Spectrum

I generally prefer languages that are close to ML ("Meta Language"), i.e. _mostly functional programming_. This should explain most of my picks e.g. JavaScript within dynamically-typed's, Scala within JVM's, Rust within unmanaged's.
