Realistic scenario: Text in Imagery:
1. Graphic text (scanned documents...)
2. Scene text (clothing, signs, packages...)

OCR pipeline:
1. Two-Step: A) text detection module that detects and ocalizes the existence of text; B) text recognition module that transcribes and converts the content of the detected text region into linguistic symbols.
2. End-to-End: single module with detection & recognition.

Tesseract pipeline:
1. Adaptive Thresholding
2. Page Layout Analysis
3.
