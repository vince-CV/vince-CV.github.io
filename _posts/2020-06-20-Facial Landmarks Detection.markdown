This repo are implementing facial landmarks detection and its applications. Facial landmarks can be achieved by a variety of techniques such as DNN. This repos implemented landmark detection using ensemble learning of regression ferns.
This repo contains item:
- Training a landmarks detector
- Ficial landmarks detection;
- Ficial landmarks applications;
An public github repo also released: <https://github.com/vince-CV/cv-facial-landmarks-applications>

## Theory of Facial Landmarks Detection
Ensemble of Regression Trees: a collection of gradient tree boosting:
1. Cascade of Regression: input a current shape estimae & facial image, and output the change in the current estimate that will produce a refined shape estimate.
2. Learning a Regressor: **a**. for each training image, choose an initial shapes by randomly sampling shapes from the shapes in the training set; **b**. calculate residual for each shape pair; **c**. train the regressor, so on so forth.

3. Regressor: **a**. each regressor is made up of K weak regressors; **b**. each weak regressor has a regression treem and the regressor is trained using gradient boosting; **c**. at each node of decision tree, test a feature and decide to either go left and right.
4. Features used in landmarks detector: pixel differences between two randomly selected pixels on the face;

## Facial Landmarks Application

### Technique CV Fundamentals
1. Alpha blending:
    * Background and Foreground: I = alpha\times B + (1-alpha)\times F
2. Affine transformation:
    * Affine: linear trasform (6 degree of freedom: 2-translation 1-oritation 1-shear 2-scale);
    * Perspective/Homography: nonlinear transform (8 degree of freedom).
3. Triangle warping:
    * image will be divided into non-overlapping triangles;
    * warping functions applied only at the verticles of the triangles to obtain locations in the output image.
4. Delaunay Trianglation:
    For generating non-overlapping triangles that cover the entire image.
5. Similarity transfrom
    An Affine transform without any shear. 

### Landmarks Applications
1. Face Averaging: Normalization wrt size, similarity transform for landmarks, align 2 landmarks of eyes. Align other facial landmarks: use landmarks to divided images into triangular regions before averaging pixel values.

2. Face Morphing: Find point correspondences using Landmark Detection, Coordinate transformation, Delaunay triangulation and Warping images and alpha blending.

3. Radial Distortion (Bug eyes): 
* Apply radial distortion to the eye patch: **a**. r_d = r+k\times r\times cos(pi\times r): to handle the artifact (curled corners) that outside r values: set distortion of 0, when r>0.5. **b**. Interpolate the points using remap function in opencv (pincushion distortion): r_d = r-k\times r\times cos(pi\times r).
4. Head Pose Estimation: **a**. Estimate 3D object: finding 6 numbers: 3 rotaion and 3 translation; **b**. Get Pitch Roll Yaw angles from rotation vector (RQDecomposition).
5. Swap Faces: Delaunay Triangulation + Affine warp triangles;
6. Beardify Filter: Delaunay Triangulation + Affine warp triangles + Alpha Blending using a transparency mask.
7. Aging Filter: Estimate Forehead Points + Predict based on current landmarks + Generate Mask using Convex hull.

8. Non-linear Deformations with Moving Least Square. For example the happify filter.
